However, in these\ntimes it's more likely for chances of Slavic\nLiberation to show up, and we believe Vladivostok, a city far from now, the Soviet Watch shall be the place of interest for our movement."

panslavia_pan_slavia_events.8.d:0 "As we have known since the times of Stalin, in theory, he was supposed to carry Lenin's legacy and make the Soviet Union a strong proletarian nation of workers. However, Stalin's rule can be comparable to people like Hitler and Mussolini. Constant purges, gulags, heavy censorship, forced quotas, oppression, and deaths are in the millions. Stalin wasn't any better than other capitalist, fascist, or other ideological leaders. However many people today see him as a "staunch nationalist bolshevik" and believe that the Fascist Circles in our nation shall continue his legacy in "the correct way".\n\nThose promises are nothing more than a bunch of lies, with the far-right circles in the country composed of different factions, all with their tyrannical ideals, we, therefore, gotta strike them and make sure we don't get second Stalin from them. Consequently, we must think of how to weaken or destroy the enemies of the people within our republic."
